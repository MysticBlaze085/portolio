                    <span style="padding-left: 3em;"></span>Code for me is a super power and I love a challenge and a chance to create any
                    solution for a client. It brings me so much joy to see clients succeeding. <br />The best experience honestly is helping
                    others succeed. I have the determination and drive to learn anything necessary for the project at hand.
